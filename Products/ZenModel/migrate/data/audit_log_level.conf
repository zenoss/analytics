## Audit Log configuration file
##
##  NOTE:
##  Any changes to this file on remote hubs/collectors will be overridden when
##  updating the hub/collector. All modifications to the audit configuration
##  should be made on the Zenoss master.
##
##  This config file enables/disables auditing of specific items
##  and sets their log level.
##
##  Acceptable levels:  Critical, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, None
##
##  Actions through the UI start with "UI."
##  Actions from the command line start with "Shell."
##  Actions run automatically from the system start with "System."
##
##  Here are common kinds of audits:
##       Authentication, Collector, Dashboard, DataPoint, DataSource,
##       Device, DeviceClass, DeviceGroup, DeviceReport, DeviceRouter,
##       DynamicService, DynamicServiceOrganizer, GeocodeCache,
##       Graph, GraphDefinition, GraphReport, Group, Hub, InterfaceSettings,
##       Job, Location, LogicalNode, LogicalNodeOrganizer, Notification,
##       NotificationWindow, Organizer, Process, Report, Service, Setting,
##       Template, Threshold, Trigger, User, ZenPack, zProperty
##
##  Here are common kinds from the command line:
##       Comment, Daemon, Script, ZenPack, DcAdmin
##
##  The default level is info, and can be set by using a level alone on a line:

info

##  Other levels can be set with:
##
##  source_a = level_1
##  source_a.kind_b = level_2
##  source_a.kind_b.action_c = level_3
##
##  messages with source_a, but not kind_b will log at level_1
##  messages with source_a and kind_b, but not action_c will log at level_2
##  messages with source_a, kind_b, and action_c will log at level_3
